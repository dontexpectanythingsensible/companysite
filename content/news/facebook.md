As a result of Facebook leaking everyone's information everywhere, and the on-going scandal around Cambridge Analytica, I've decided to delete Don't Expect Anything Sensible's Facebook page.

You'll be able to find out news about our games, including development diaries and gameplay updates, in a number of ways:

- This blog!
- [We're on Twitter: @reallysensible](https://www.twitter.com/reallysensible)
- We also have a mailing list - sign up using the form below.

Ok bye!
